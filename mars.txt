Once I arrived on Mars, I knew that I would never return...those red rocks beat Colorado every time!
On Mars, it's always daytime - party!
Dear Diary, I've fallen in love with a Martian. We're going to elope!
We've begun a small potato farm on the outskirts of Mars City. We're happy here.
Perhaps we will one day return to Earth...
